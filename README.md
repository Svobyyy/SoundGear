### What I Am Most Proud Of and What I'd Do Differently Next Time 🚀
#

#### What I Am Most Proud Of: 🎉
- **Project Structure & Best Practices:** I focused on creating a clean, scalable, and maintainable structure, which is super helpful for future projects. This has also enhanced my understanding of React hooks and coding best practices. 🛠️
- **Next.js App Router:** Learning to use the newest App Router in Next.js (moving from the Pages Router). ⚡
- **Data Validation:** Implementing validation across all parts of the website, ensuring user, product, and payment data are thoroughly validated, made It more robust and reliable. ✅

#### What I'd Do Differently Next Time: 🔄
- **Start with Best Practices from the Beginning:** While I refined the structure and code during development, I realized how much time could be saved by implementing best practices early on. Next time, I’ll ensure an optimal structure from the start to avoid unnecessary refactoring. ⏳

#

### Challenges I Encountered and How I Overcame Them: 💡
- **Data Validation:** I wasn’t sure how to handle both client-side and server-side validation at first. After researching, I used a combination of Regex and Zod, which were new to me, but ultimately made the validation process smoother and improved my skills. 🔍
